    <h1 class="post">Rails vs Express: A Backend Comparison</h1>

    <p>
      When it comes to web development, there are no perfect solutions. Every
      problem-solving strategy carries with it tradeoffs that can make settling
      upon a specific tool and/or architecture a complex endeavor. As such, I’ve
      taken it upon myself to set up two full-stack applications in an effort to
      get some practice at analyzing the pros and cons of each schema. Both apps
      feature a React front end, but the backends differ: one utilizes Rails and
      the other Express. Both apps also feature user authentication.
    </p>

    <h3>Rails + React + PostgreSQL</h3>

    <p>
      When I embarked upon this project, my instinct was to incorporate Devise,
      the famous (infamous?) authentication gem, into the Rails backend. This
      proved to be somewhat more challenging than I initially thought it would
      be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Devise requires that a root route be specified, so I set up a
      <code>&lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      on the view governed by the controller action to which the root route was
      pointing (
      <code>‘welcome#home’</code>
      ), and populated this
      <code>div</code>
      with the React app by means of
      <code><%= javascript_pack_tag ‘index’ %></code>
      . This also required me to point webpack to
      <code>create-react-app</code>
      as the front end source rather than the default
      <code>javascript_packs folder</code>
      provided by Rails. From there I created the components for my front end
      and created my own
      <code>SessionsController</code>
      , which inherited from Devise’s
      <code>SessionsController</code>
      and which I instructed Devise to use. When I had wired up my front end
      appropriately to communicate with my backend routes, which also required a
      special namespace for Devise actions, everything appeared to be working
      correctly until I tried to sign out and then sign back in. My Rails server
      indicated a CSRF error, despite my sending along the CSRF token in the
      header of each AJAX request. This threw me for a loop momentarily, but I
      soon realized what the issue was: upon signing out the first time, the
      CSRF token was changed. I was pulling the token that I was sending from
      the front end from the meta tags provided by Rails, but since the front
      end app was single page and not re-rendering from the server upon each
      sign out and sign in, the meta tag was not reflecting the change made to
      the CSRF token upon sign out. This quickly became a time-consuming
      nuscience, so I scrapped this approach and decided to roll my own
      token-based authentication scheme without Devise. This was a fairly
      challenging task, as this approach was new to me, but once I figured out
      what was going on, the app worked as expected.
    </p>

    <h3>Express + React + Mongoose</h3>

    <p>
      Express is a different animal from Rails in that it’s an extremely
      lightweight framework. A more analogous Ruby counterpart in terms of
      abstraction and out-of-the-box functionality might be Sinatra, but from a
      popularity standpoint, Rails is a better analogue to the extremely widely
      used Express, hence my decision to compare these two seemingly disparate
      tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my building of the Express backend, I was immediately faced with a
      decision that did not come up when considering my Rails application: what
      database should I use? Rails uses SQL databases by default on top of which
      Rails lays its very powerful Active Record module that provides
      user-friendly abstractions for SQL database manipulation. While it is
      certainly possible to use a noSQL database with Rails, it requires a good
      bit of custom configuration and renders useless Active Record, one of
      Rails most powerful conveniences. Express does not come with any database
      by default nor does it come with a default view layer. Every Express app
      that requires a database requires the developer to incorporate the ORM of
      his/her choice upon creation of the app. Given my many options, I decided
      on a MogoDB database powered by the Mongoose ORM based on the massive
      popularity that the MERN stack is enjoying at the moment. While it’s nice
      to have this level of flexibility, I paid a small time cost as a result of
      having to configure Mongoose. While it isn’t doesn’t require a massive
      amount of code, it’s not nothing, and this is the sort of configuration
      that comes up again and again with a lightweight framework like Express.
      The time adds up over the course of building an entire app or feature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regarding authentication, the Express app features a very similar
      JWT-based authentication system. Both the Rails and NPM ecosystems feature
      JWT packages that facilitate this strategy and make implementation fairly
      straightforward. However, the Passport authentication library, which I did
      not utilize in this particular project is one other advantage of Express
      over Rails where JWT authentication, and, more generally, full stack app
      authentication is concerned. Passport supports JWT authentication along
      with a long list of other authentication strategies. With Passport
      properly configured, an Express app is poised to incorporate additional
      modes of authentication with relative ease. This would be a much more
      involved and time-consuming process in a full stack Rails+React app.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      Rails is an extremely opinionated framework that assumes a specific
      architecture and certain naming conventions. A developer who is able to
      adhere to these expectations is rewarded with a bevy of built-in
      functionality that Rails abstracts away and executes under the hood
      without explicit, time-consuming boilerplate configuration. Express, on
      the other hand, is far less concerned about file structure and file names,
      but requires much more explicit configuration to get things up and
      running. So, while Rails is technically a more powerful tool that quickly
      developed a reputation in its early days for prototyping that virtually
      coded itself, it is not terribly flexible.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, once I abandoned Devise and decided to roll my own JWT
      authentication in Rails, the experience of building the two backends was
      very similar. If you plan on using a SQL database and your app won’t be
      handling a huge number of users, Rails might be the better choice given
      that Rails provides convenient generators to make setting up models and
      data tables very easy. However, if your app utilizes packages or patterns
      that Rails does not favor out of the box, Express will likely be the more
      straightforward solution.
